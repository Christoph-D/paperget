#+END_EXAMPLE

This searches on http://dblp.org/ and automatically fetches the pdf
and the accompanying bibtex file, renaming the files and updating the
bibtex information to comply with the bibtex key.

Download of pdf files works for several common journals/archives.  If
the pdf download fails, it falls back to google.

Currently bibtex files always come from DBLP.

The path ~/papers/ and the bibtex key schema are hardcoded.
